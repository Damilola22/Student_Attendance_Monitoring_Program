# Student_Attendance_Monitoring_Program
This program uses anonymised student data to identify students who are not engaging with the course modules with the aim of providing support to students who fall into this group.
It visualises the students module attendance, their attendance in comparison with the average class attendance and other students. The Program identifies students with good attendance who are engaging with the course module and those with poor attendance who may be struggling with the modules
